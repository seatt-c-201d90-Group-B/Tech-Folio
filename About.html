        <p id="aboutPerson1">Hello there, my name is Elias Staehle. Before switching to a career for software development I served in the United States Marine Corps. I have always had large ambitions for non-profit organizations and as we have continued to evolve to become more dependent on technology it became clear that maintaining a career in the tech industry was imperative for creating an effective non-profit. As I begin my career I'd like to get as much experience as I can. I hope to start this off with by working with a FAANG company giving me the experience of a proven method for creating a successful tech company. When I was in the Marine Corps I worked as a machinist and one the the lessons I learned the fastest was that you do not work by the book on projects in real life. You need to learn and understand how to improvise and create a working situation regardless of the task or problem.</p>

        <p id="aboutPerson2">Before I switched over to software development, I was working as a delivery driver for
          Amazon. Working there helped me develop a growth mindset which is critical in becoming a good software dev.
          <br>
          I have always been passionate about computers and how they help us solve problems in day to day life. I chose
          to
          transition into software development at this point in my life to equip myself with the technical know how and
          skills to be able to create software that helps make people lives easier. And most importantly to be able to
          do
          what I love for work.

        <p id="aboutPerson5"> Hello, My name is Trace Dugar.  I am a former audio engineer, who has become a software developer.  I decided to come into software development due to the need for software developers.  I feel as though I can bring some good ideas to the table especially whenever projects involve audio. The ideal environment would be in my at home studio, while doing software development in order to clean up audio if necessary.  I have also studied a bit of design at Loyola, and feel as though this helps whenever I am working on the UI of a page. </p>
